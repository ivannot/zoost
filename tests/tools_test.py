"""
The checkers are the safety net, so a broken one is the worst failure this project can have: it
reports success over the thing it was built to catch, and everyone stops looking.

That is not hypothetical. Two of these shipped broken on the day they were written. `sitecheck`
stripped fenced blocks from the store listings — where the fence *is* the copy that gets published —
and so passed on prose it had never read. Keeping the fences was worse: the inline-code pattern then
paired one fence's closing backticks with the next one's opening ticks and deleted everything
between two unrelated sections, emptying the file and reporting zero findings.

Every test below plants a defect that actually reached the user and asserts it is caught.
